She is India's first female firefighter whose life inspires one to live trying and achieve the seemingly impossible. Harshini reminisced about the time she finally got accepted into the NFSC (National Fire Service College). She talked about how her father called to give her the good news as he held onto the telegram in his hand. Harshini's seven-semester course needed the students to live on campus, but for her, the rule was bent- allowing her to go home. Harshini worked with heavy water and suction hoses and performed mock drills with dummies. Her first assignment was a cylinder blast in Shirdi, when she was in college. Harshini performed difficult tasks while she was just a student learning the ways of life and fire fighting at the same time. Before joining ONGC in 2006 (and eventually becoming the Sr. fire officer), she dealt with several fires across Mumbai, Kolkata and Delhi where her six-hour operation in a tin factory gained recognition.

Center for Bamboo Cone Development (CBCD), Assam Hailing from the small town of Kottayam in Kerala, Jessie Jayaraj did not have grand dreams of being an entrepreneur. But she set on a mission to spread awareness about natural fibers against plastic by promoting natural products. What started from a small room and with one tailor's help has now become an enterprise in Tondiarpet, where products like bags, files, and stationery products are stitched. \"As an alternative for synthetic products, take orders for products made of cotton, bamboo fiber, jute, to name a few,\" she said. \"Corporate companies, which have a huge employee base, play an important role in spreading awareness against non-biodegradable products. They give away a lot of promotional products, which could be made using natural fibers,\" said Jessie. \"MNCs have become much more conscious about the use of natural fibers,\" she added. Her unit now hires around 40 tailors who work with her six days a week. Speaking about her role, she said: \"I do everything from meeting clients to taking orders, working on design, then as a salesperson and delivering too,\" said Jessie, adding, \"I believe my making such products popular among masses is the best role can play to spread awareness. It has taken long, long years to reach here and where stand today is the result of sheer hard work\". Jessie, said the growth process was a tough one, yet humbling. The mother of two built her venture with a very small investment, amidst several challenges on the personal and business fronts. Jessie is aiming at export orders now. * Source: https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/in-other-news/120317/chennai-weaving-her-way- to-success.html \"The above information is for training purposes only and will not be used for any commercial gains * You like to solve problems * You are comfortable in a team * You are physically fit * You have good communication skills EDUCATIONAL PATHWAY Minimum Qualification + After completion of class 10 and minimum age required is 18 years old for enrolling for National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)\" Level 2 course for Operator - Boring machine course q q . . . \\ x \"NSOQF is a nationally integrated education and competency-based framework that enables persons to acquire desired \"These figures are taken from NCS and are indicative competency levels in a chosen field.

School of Fashion Technology, Pune Entrepreneur Tarishi Jain is definitely someone who would choose handmade items over anything else. In 2015, when she was pregnant with her daughter, her mother-in-law knitted a beautiful frock which she was completely taken by. Skilled in knitting and crocheting during her school days, she decided to take it up again. \"I had always loved engaging in these activities but had lost touch over time. Seeing the beautiful frock, was taken back to the time when crocheted and made beautiful TV covers, handkerchiefs, and laces. So, decided to try my hand at it again and in two days, too had made a beautiful frock for my daughter,\" recalls the 34-year-old. Over time, these beautiful handcrafted items started being noticed by her friends and acquaintances who would request her to knit items for their infants. The demand only grew - which pushed Tarishi towards identifying more people who knew the art of knitting and crocheting. She also felt that by starting a venture, she could support several women who could work from the comfort of their homes. This is what led to the birth of 'Ajoobaa' in 2018. Ajoobaa is a startup that sells handmade wool crochet and knitted wear that is available for children up to four years. The start-up is based out of Sonipat in Haryana where the operations are carried out actively. After Tarishi founded the start-up, her husband Nivesh too quit his job and started looking after the operations at Ajoobaa. Now, almost over four years later, Ajoobaa gets about 4,000 orders in a month! The start-up, in the last one year, has dressed at least 20,000 children. They are currently working with 112 artisans, mostly homemakers who make these beautiful products by hand. In the past year, Ajoobaa has had an annual turnover of Rs 1.4 Crore despite managing their operations on a small scale. * Source: htips://www.thebetterindia.com/238682/knitwear-crochet-buy-online-business-home-setup- startup-haryana-entrepreneurs-children-clothing-winter-ang136/ Q. information is for training purposes only and will not be used for any commercial gains + You are physically fit * You like to have clear instructions to follow + You pay attention to details while working EDUCATIONAL PARTWAY Minimum Qualification After completing class 8 and being 18 years of age you can enrol for National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF)' level 4 Doors and Windows Fixer training \"NSOQF is a nationally integrated education and competency-based framework that enables persons to acquire desired competency levels in a chosen field.

RAJASTHAN INSTITUTE OF WOOD CARVING, JAIPUR, RAJASTHAN When Karo Sambhav first started to spread the concept of responsible recycling some scrap merchants known as aggregators-simply shut their doors. Being able to build confidence was crucial so a few of the organization's field staff moved into homes in neighbourhoods where aggregators lived like Seelampur in New Delhi or Kurla in Mumbai, India's financial capital. Eventually relationships were formed. Suhaib Malik is a third-generation aggregator, one of the hundreds based in Mustafabad. His father and grandfather traded in scrap iron for decades. The 26-year-old ventured into the unknown, but promising, e-waste sector in 2018 when he heard how others were making a lot more money by switching. Now he is expanding his operation further by doing business sustainably with Karo Sambhav. Working conditions in his shop and his financial bottom-line have improved. \"We don't even have to break down the keyboards anymore,\" he says. \"We just hand them over as is.\" This exempts his workers from hours of harmful labour dealing with toxic waste. Now, every couple of weeks a truck drives in to weigh the electronics and pack them neatly into bar-coded gunny sacks to be taken to certified responsible recyclers. Steady demand from this new customer means \"business has improved a lot,\" notes Malik, whose shop has defunct CPUs and keyboards stacked outside. He sources e-waste from about 100 smaller dealers in New Delhi, as well as eastern Indian states of Bihar and West Bengal some 1,000 miles away.

But the formation of those beads into a delicate jewelry piece amazed me. realized beads are far more versatile than thought. So, decided to replace every accessory wear with beads by blending my artistry with sheer utility values,\" she says. It took seven years before Sneha decided to pursue her passion in jewellery making. And with her passion to become an entrepreneur, Yuvanta was born. Today Yuvanta has a large range of dcor items like long-beaded curtains, sparkling window-blinds, drapes, show-pieces and the like. Usual jewelry options like necklaces, earrings, nose-pins, head-wears, hair-do accessories, bracelets, anklets and others are also aplenty in Sneha's collection. She plans to enhance more utility items in a bid to give a beaded twist to daily life. Yuvanta now has a manufacturing unit in Kozhikode. Sneha has a few words of wisdom to share with aspiring entrepreneurs who want to venture into the designing field. \"Choose your medium well; because that determines your destiny.

Though he tried working as a security guard, it did not come off as he was afraid of working alone at night. So, finally, Pillai landed a job as a waiter at a hotel in the town with a monthly salary of Rs 450. After hours of slogging at the busy hotel, Pillai pursued pre-degree in a parallel college. Often he assisted the main cook in the kitchen by cutting vegetables. The chief cook took him under his wings after noticing that the newly-joined waiter was slicing sacks of onion faster than any of his trained assistants and taking a passionate interest in cooking. Pillai shelved his pre-degree plans due to work pressure, but it was the beginning of Pillai's journey to becoming one of the world's most celebrated chefs. Pillai's life is an inspiration to all and illustrates how one could scale heights with hard work and determination.

Armed with degrees in engineering and masters in social entrepreneurship, they founded Sampurn(e)arth a Mumbai-based startup focused on urban waste management. Vijaya Srinivasan, a client, shares that the residents of her neighbourhood were initially very reluctant. They didn't want to go through the whole process of having two separate bags and segregating food at the source. Six months of tireless campaigning later, the efforts of the team are starting to make a difference. Though there is a long way to go to change the perception of people, co-founder and director Debatra Banerjee feels that this change is headed in the correct direction. Sampurn(e)arth also works to provide waste collectors with dignity employing waste collectors to work under proper conditions. They earn more money, thanks to their recycling efforts. Above all, instead of being just 'waste pickers', they proudly wear on their sleeve the new title of 'waste managers.
